Hello, I am StarBoy and I am a novice at programming and I can make simple HTML websites and Javascript games and maybe a very simple Python Calculator!

I have created a game called "Galaxy Blast", it is a simple and basic clone of the retro  80s game Galaga. Galaxy Blast can be played on PC anywhere you go! Maybe you are bored
in school and you have access to a PC or you're on a vaction and have a graphically limited PC then Galaxy Blast will be a great game for you to pass the time. 
If you want to play Galaxy Blast via sololearn, which I highly urge you to do! Visit: https://www.sololearn.com/en/compiler-playground/WgLrfq3vz7Pd

Galaxy Blast is already 2 years old.. I started this project somewhere in early 2023 and it went through a lot of updates and bug fixing with the past few years and it has finally
reached my satisfaction. For now.. Ofcourse I plan to add more stuff to this game so more people can enjoy it even more!
